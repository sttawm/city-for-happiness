A city designed around happiness

* Continued adult education for all
* Homes are built with shared facilities
* Incentives for families to live near each other
* Each resident is responsible for a city "chore"
* Lots of bike lanes
* Lots of parks
* Lots of green
* Clean public bathrooms
* Health-care for all (no f**cking taxes!)
